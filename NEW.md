## What i have learned
I have learned about pull requests, forks, repositories and cloning. Pull requests are used to propose changes to a project. 
Forks serve a somewhat similar purpose, but with forks you clone it into your own repository. Repositories contain the code of a given project, and can be cloned to your computer using git clone.
